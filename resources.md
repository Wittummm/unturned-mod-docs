# Resources

***

There is seemingly a lack information onm modding unless you dig through the various steam guides. This is what my documentation tries to combat but it's not like I know everything. The official documentation is lacking in details. The official discord has many great resource links to information but they are not organized and are mostly just (steam) guides. A good way to get detailed information is to ask people in the discord directly, but this is not ideal as the information is just passed around in the community. The best way is to dig into the example files but going into the files is just a hassle as there are no explanations and you have to make your own interpretation.

TL;DR you can ignore above text if you just want to get the resources<br>
